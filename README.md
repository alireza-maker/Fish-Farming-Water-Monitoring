The project consists in building a system prototype for monitoring the quality of water in which takes place the fish farming. There are many kinds of fish farming depending on the dimensions, localization, and intensivity of the farming. For all of these kind of farming the main important variable to take under control is the quality of water, where quality is a general topic under which they are included the percentage of fitoplancton and zooplankton (food), the peercentage of oxygen, the presence of nitrogen dioxide, nitrogen catabolites, ammonia, droppings (dejections produced by fishes), the	percentage of Ph and Salinity and the 	bioaccumulation of heavy metals, dioxins, polychlorinated biphenyls. The measurements are taken with a spectrometer in vitro, without the need to take a water sample by a human intervention. 
The spectrometer will read the light diffration frequencies and  an "unknown thing" can be measured by using the  Pocket Geiger Counter in order to test the material under evaluation.  Each material sample (water) should have a different signature that can be analysed according intelligence available on machine learning of AWS IOT platform.
This monitoring will be useful to understand the level of the main quality variables of water in order to actuate an adjustment of some environment parameters. For example the actuator could activate fitoplancton and zooplankton dispensers, or Ph corrector , or alerts which warn that water or location  should be changed.
